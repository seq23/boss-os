# Install the launch agent that lets Boss OS reach the owner's Mac.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Boss OS can now dispatch a run to `bk_claude_code` — the consumer creates it, the
# guard admits it, and it sits in `backend_runs` with status 'running', awaiting a claim. Nothing
# claimed it, because nothing on this machine was running the agent. `scripts/sync-agent/runner.mjs`
# has existed for a while and no launchd job, cron entry or login item ever invoked it: "exists but
# nothing invokes it", which is the whole reason the Executive Intelligence Report never appeared.
#
# WHAT IT RUNS, AND WHAT IT EMPHATICALLY DOES NOT. `agent.mjs work-once` — ask the cloud whether a
# run is waiting for this machine, and if one is, execute it through Claude Code and report the
# evidence. If nothing is queued it exits in about a second having done nothing. It does not watch,
# record, screenshot or observe anything; it has no eyes on the machine at all. The only thing it
# reads is a task Boss OS itself dispatched.
#
# One-shot on a timer rather than the `work` daemon: no long-lived process sits holding her session.
#
# THE SKY SNAPSHOT RUNS FIRST, and it is separated by `;` rather than `&&` on purpose: if it fails
# the run must still happen. The first real report filed three gaps because it went to the open web
# for planetary positions this system already computes to about an arcminute, and got 403s. It was
# right to refuse to invent them; it simply had no way to ask. `sky-snapshot.mjs` leaves SKY.json in
# the workspace so it never has to.
#
# THE PASSCODE IS READ FROM THE VAULT AND NEVER WRITTEN ANYWHERE. `vault:run` puts BOSS_PASSCODE in
# the child's environment for the life of the process; the agent exchanges it for a session cookie
# and holds no credential of its own. The plist contains no secret, which is why it is safe to keep
# in version control.

# The first draft ran every fifteen minutes, which is ninety-six process starts a day for a queue

#
# The report duty fires at 06:30 Central, so the first three slots cover it and two retries. The
# midday and evening slots catch anything dispatched by hand during the day. A run dispatched at
# 15:00 waits until 18:35 rather than for ever, and `npm run vault:run -- node
# scripts/sync-agent/agent.mjs work-once` claims it immediately if she does not want to wait.

# ─── The Wednesday packet reminder ───────────────────────────────────────────
#
# A SEPARATE JOB, because it runs on two weekdays rather than five times a day, and merging two
# schedules into one plist means the packet either fires five times a day or the agent runs twice a
# week. StartCalendarInterval takes a Weekday, so each job says plainly when it runs.
#
# WEDNESDAY 07:00 ONLY, WHICH WAS HER CALL. It also fired Tuesday at 17:00, on my reasoning that a
# blocking item needs hours to act on. Asked directly, she wanted Wednesday morning alone — and that
# follows from what the packet turned out to be FOR: showing him the week's work, which is read on
# the way into the meeting rather than acted on the night before.
